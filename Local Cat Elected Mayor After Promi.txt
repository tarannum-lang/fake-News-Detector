Local Cat Elected Mayor After Promising “Longer Naps and Fewer Mondays”

Springfield — In an unprecedented landslide victory, a three‑year‑old tabby named Whiskers has been elected mayor of Springfield after campaigning on a platform of “longer naps, mandatory sunbeam breaks, and abolishing Mondays.”

Voter turnout reached record highs after Whiskers’ viral debate performance, during which he knocked over a glass of water belonging to his opponent and then stared unblinkingly into the camera for 47 seconds.

“I trust him,” said local resident Maria Jenkins. “He’s consistent, calm, and only occasionally knocks things off shelves.”

Whiskers’ first executive order reportedly includes installing cardboard boxes in all public offices and replacing the city alarm system with a gentle purring sound.

Economic analysts are uncertain how the feline administration will handle infrastructure, but insiders say Whiskers is “very focused on bird-related policy.”

City Hall has confirmed that daily press briefings will now consist of silent judgment and intermittent stretching.
