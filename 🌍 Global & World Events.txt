Canadian police say eight people have been killed in a mass shooting at a school and home in the remote rural community of Tumbler Ridge in the western province of British Columbia.

Six people were killed and at least 25 others were injured at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. The suspect, 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar, was found dead at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot injury, police said.

Two others - the suspect's mother, 39, and step-brother, 11 - were also found dead at a nearby home.

This is what we know so far about one of the deadliest gun attacks in Canada's history.
